# hello-world
This repository is for practicing code within GitHub.
My name is Brandon Deasey. I am in the process of teaching myself code to begin my career in Tech. I have served 8 years in the United States Navy and will be honorably discharged in MArch of 2025. I recently turned down a commissioning offer for the Navy because entering a career field I believe in means far more to me than a steady paycheck and a job that I don't have to challenge myself with.
